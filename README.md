# Introduction

The end vision for this project is to be a compendium of information learned throughout the course of one's career in computer science, with a particular emphasis on topics that appear most frequently during software engineering.

The first section of this book will start with a fresh introduction to computer science. No prior experience with programming or CS will be assumed, but the reader should be comfortable with high school level math \(algebra and geometry\). It will cover the basics of computing, including types, variables, functions, testing, conditionals, loops, recursion, and object-oriented programming.

The second section will focus on intermediate programming concepts \(those most often covered in the typical object-oriented programming / data structures courses in college\). This section will cover object-oriented programming more in depth, and go over data structures, complexity, and basic algorithms.

Further extensions to this resource will be added as time permits.
