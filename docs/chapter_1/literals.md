# Literals

A **literal** is an expression that looks like a value.
An easy way to tell if something is a literal: if you type it into the Python
shell, hit enter, and the result Python gives you back looks like the expression
you typed in, that expression is a literal.

So, for example, `1` would be a literal, since Python would give you back `1`
if you typed that in, but `1 + 2` would not be a literal, since Python would
give you back `3` if you typed that in.
