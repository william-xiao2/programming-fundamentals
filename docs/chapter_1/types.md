# Types

So far, all of the examples given of expressions that you can input into the
Python shell have been quite barebones - either just a number, or a simple
addition of two numbers. If that was all you could do with Python, things
would get boring very quickly, and you'd be very limited in what you could do.

What if you wanted to add decimal numbers? What if you wanted to work
with text? These are things we do with our computers every day. Surely
Python must have a way to represent these.

In fact, Python does. In order to understand them, however, we must go over
the concept of **types**.

Formally, a **type** is a set of values and the operations on them. This definition
may seem abstract, but in essence, a type defines two things:
- What kind of data is available for use?
- What can we do with this data?

The basic, fundamental types built into Python will be shown in the
following sections.
