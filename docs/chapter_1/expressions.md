# Expressions

An expression is something that you type into Python (or any other programming language).
The computer hasn't done anything with this expression you typed in yet, however.
It's just there.

Expressions can include a wide variety of things. For example,
- Simple numbers. Typing `42` into the Python shell would be an expression.
  So, as an example, if you were to enter the Python shell and type `42`, like so:
  ```
  Python 3.7.4 (default, Aug 13 2019, 15:17:50)
  [Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on darwin
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>> 42
  ```
  That `42` you typed after the `>>>` would be an expression.

- Text. For example, you can type something in between quotes (the quotes
  are necessary for Python to recognize it as text and not as code instructions)
  and that would be an expression.
  As an example:
  ```
  Python 3.7.4 (default, Aug 13 2019, 15:17:50)
  [Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on darwin
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>> "Hello, World!"
  ```
  That `"Hello, World!"` you typed would be an expression.

- Expressions can also be more complicated and relate two simpler expressions.
  For example, we can use math formulas to elevate Python to a glorified calculator:
  ```
  Python 3.7.4 (default, Aug 13 2019, 15:17:50)
  [Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on darwin
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>> 9 + 10
  ```
  That `9 + 10` you typed would be an expression.
